### Cloud Storage Service Company
This project consists of a cloud storage service which will enable the user:
- Simple File Storage: Upload, download, and remove files.

- Password Management: Save, edit, and delete website credentials.
- Unit and Integration tests have been added.

### Backend System for a Car Website
In this project I created a REST API to store vehicle data. The primary Vehicles API will perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update and Delete) related to vehicle details like make, model, color, etc., and it will need to consume data from other APIs as well regarding location and pricing data.
- Swagger-based API documentation is included.
- The architecture follows the Eureka MSA.
- Unit and Integration tests have been added.
